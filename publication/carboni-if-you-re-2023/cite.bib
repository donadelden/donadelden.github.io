 abstract = {In recent years, QR (Quick Response) codes have gained popularity in facilitating information sharing with camera-equipped devices like smartphones and tablets. This technology is suitable for multiple applications, such as verification of COVID-19 vaccination, multi-factor authentication, or ease URL and contact sharing. Despite its huge adoption, security researchers have mainly focused on using QR codes as a vector for phishing attacks, exploiting the simplicity of hiding malicious URLs in a not human-readable format. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg of the potential QR codes have in being a suitable vector for cyberattacks.},
