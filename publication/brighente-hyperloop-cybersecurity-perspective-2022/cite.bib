 abstract = {We propose the first analysis of the cybersecurity challenges of the Hyperloop technology. Based on known threats of similar Cyber-Physical Systems, we identify the vulnerabilities of the Hyperloop infrastructure. We then discuss possible countermeasures and future directions for the security of the future Hyperloop design.},
